        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Sure, here's your bio based on the information from your resume:

I am a dedicated scholar with a strong academic background in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in AI, Data mining, Graph Neural Networks, Automated Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Central South University in China, focusing on the research area of "Prediction-based graph neural architecture search."

My educational journey began with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Technology from the National School of Applied Economics and Management in Benin. I furthered my studies with a Master's degree at Wuhan University of Technology, where I delved into Big Data Mining, Knowledge Graph, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. My Master's thesis explored "Knowledge Extraction from Textbooks Combining NLP and Deep Learning."

In my ongoing pursuit of knowledge and expertise, I have honed my programming skills in Python, delving into areas such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and more. I have a wide range of experience with frameworks and libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, and proficiency in database management systems like MySQL and MongoDB.

My academic and research journey has been marked by significant projects, including my work on "Progressive Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Architecture Search in Distributed Environments," where I am designing and implementing a novel knowledge distillation framework. Another project, "Ranking Prediction-based Spectral Graph Neural Architecture Search Framework for Graph Anomaly Detection," saw me designing a novel spectral graph neural architecture search framework and utilizing ranking prediction methods for improved model selection.

I have also ventured into the field of cancer drug response prediction with "Cancer drug response prediction with surrogate modeling-based graph neural architecture search," where I conducted data analysis, implemented surrogate modeling techniques, and utilized graph neural networks to model complex relationships within biological data.

My contribution to the field extends to "Prediction-based graph neural architecture search," where I developed the GraphNAP framework to efficiently select optimal Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. This work was published in renowned journals, including "Machine Learning" and "Knowledge and Information Systems."

Furthermore, I have participated in numerous competitions and achieved recognition. I was awarded the second prize in the 16th Citi Cup Financial Innovation Application Competition for my contributions to analysis and forecasting platforms based on graph neural networks.

Beyond academia, I am actively involved in various extracurricular activities and organizations. I have served as a speaker at the Science Summit during the 79th United Nations General Assembly, where I discussed open science comprehensive overviews. I also actively engage in leadership roles, including serving as the Chairman of the Federation of Associations of Beninese Students and Interns in China.

My passion for technology and research is complemented by my commitment to fostering international cultural exchange and community engagement. I have held executive positions in organizations such as the Wuhan University of Technology International Cultural Exchange Association and the Association of Benin Students and Interns in Wuhan.

In all of my endeavors, I remain dedicated to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and technology, with a focus on AI, data mining, and machine learning, and contributing to a better, more connected world through research, education, and international cooperation.
